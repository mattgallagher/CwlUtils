/**
    A simple countdown latch that uses busy waiting.
    Created with a number of steps to wait for, callers
    can count down one by one.

    A step is performed by calling `countDown()` which is,
    obviously, thread-safe.

    Instances are single-use: once the latch has counted down to zero,
    all future calls to `await()` return immediately.
